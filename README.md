## Introduction

This app helps you create chatbots that can answer questions about your documents, books, or files. You can also use it to build AI applications that use your own data. For example:

- Ask questions about a large collection of documents.
- Build a customer support chatbot that follows specific instructions.

## Creating the RAG Application

1. **Split Your Data**: Break your documents into smaller chunks (500 to 1000 words) to make them easier to handle. This helps find the most relevant information quickly and keeps costs down since only parts of a document are used at a time.

2. **Create Vector Embeddings**: Convert these chunks into numerical representations and store them in a database. This helps the AI understand the meaning of the text based on similarities between chunks.

3. **Perform a Similarity Search**: When a user asks a question, search for chunks that are most relevant to their query.

4. **Generate a Response**: Use the relevant chunks to help the AI generate an accurate answer and provide sources.
